# Metronome with Relay Click(tm) board

Playing with the Relay Click Board and the TMR1-CCP1 Compare Mode.

Need:

* Device: PIC16F1709 (or other PIC16F1 in 20-pin DIP)
* Board: PICDEM(tm) Low Pin Count + mikroBUS connector = [Simplicity](https://github.com/luciodj/Simplicity) 
* Debugger: PICkit(tm) 3

## The Basic Idea
1. Add a [MikroBUS](http://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus/) connector to the LPC board 
2. Connect a  [Relay Click Board](http://www.mikroe.com/click/relay/) 
3. Launch MPLAB X and MPLAB Code Configurator to quickly initialise all the peripherals
4. Tick Tock 
5. Change the time with the potentiometer ...


## Further Development Ideas
* Add more "beats" ...
